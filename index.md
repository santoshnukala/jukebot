Team roles for this week (write down name):
_This week all of us were brainstorming and discussing early possible directions for our project.
Omkar facilitated our meeting, Sahith and Rajeev were recording, Krithik and Santosh were the
planners, and all members were engaged and contributing._


1. Describe briefly what the main goal of your team is (so the peer reviewer has some
context).
_Our goal is to generate music (likely video game music) using neural networks._


I. What was done this week regarding the project: If you want to include code include
this in the Appendix. Describe what the group did (including contributions of individual
team members) with regards to the group project this week. Give enough details so I
understand what you folks have been doing over the week. Include dates of your
meeting(s) and who met on these days.

_Our full group met on Tuesday, September 1st. We had a long list of possible ideas which we
discussed in depth, and we finalized the decision to move forward with the idea of generating
music using neural nets. Other ideas included star identification, election result prediction using
polling data, medical image analysis, and using a genetic algorithm to tackle a schrodinger
equation. The prospect of generating music, likely videogame music, was ultimately the most
engaging idea to the full group. We’re planning to use MIDI files as training data and we found many possible sources,
including the following:
`
https://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/
http://www.mirsoft.info/gamemids.php
https://github.com/mdeff/fma
http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/
http://www.piano-midi.de/
http://musedata.stanford.edu/
https://composing.ai/dataset
`
We have also started to gather information on other approaches to similar problems. We found
the Google Magenta project generating Bach-like music using neural networks to be inspiring, as
well as work from OpenAI and Facebook AI Research._


II. What were obstacles faced if any in working on the project? This could be technical
(like not being able to implement or understand particular techniques) or time issues
(midterms for other courses etc).

_At this early stage we haven’t hit any major obstacles. However, when choosing an idea
initially, we were sometimes limited by our knowledge of our toolkit. As it’s so early in the term, and
we don’t have a full sense of everything we’re going to learn, we had to make some assumptions
about what plans would be both sufficiently challenging while still being feasible for our skill level.
Ultimately, we’ve chosen a topic that we feel should offer us some latitude to adapt as we learn
more techniques across the course._


III. What is the plan for the next week including what each team member is planning
to work on in the next week. Describe goals and potential timelines (“ I plan to
finish understanding x to see if it can be implemented for our project by
Wednesday etc”. )

_Prior to our next update we’re going to map out a plan for how to proceed through the term
with internal deadlines. Additionally, we’d like to wrangle a complete dataset of midi files that we
can use for training our music generation model. We’re also going to work on understanding the
implementation of the neural networks that we’ll need to use to tackle this work._
